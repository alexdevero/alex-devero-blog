# JavaScript Switch Statement - All You Need to Know

Switch statement is one of the oldest features of JavaScript. Yet, it is not used as often as `if...else`. This is unfortunate. Switch statement can sometimes do a better job and make your code more readable. This tutorial will teach you what JavaScript switch statement is, how to use it and when.

## The basics of switch statement

Every JavaScript switch statement must have three things in order to work. The first thing is the `switch` keyword. Every switch statement has to start with this keyword. The second thing is a value you want to compare. This value goes between the parenthesis that follow after the `switch` keyword, and before curly braces with block of code.

```JavaScript
// Switch statement syntax
switch (someValue) {
  // body with block of code
}
```

### Value and case blocks

JavaScript switch statement works in a similar way to `if....else` statement. In case of `if....else`, there is some condition and you "test" if that condition is either `true` or `false`. Then, you can execute code specific for each boolean value, or one of them. Switch statement uses different syntax, but the result is same.

What switch does is it operates with two parts. The first one is the value you want to check. The second part is a case block. This, the case block, is also the third thing you need to make switch statement work. Every case block you add to switch statement has to have some value.

When you execute a switch statement, it will do two things. First, it will take the value you passed in parenthesis that follow after the `switch` keyword. Second, it will compare this value with values you specified for each statement.
