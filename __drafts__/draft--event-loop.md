The JavaScript event loop is one of the most important things to understand. It helps you understand how things work under the hood. You can then use this knowledge to write better JavaScript code, and also avoid problems. In this tutorial, you will learn what JavaScript event loop is and how it works.<!--more-->

## Building blocks of JavaScript

In JavaScript, there are few fundamental building blocks. These blocks are [memory heap], [stack], [call stack], [web APIs], message queue and event loop. The memory heap is a place where JavaScript stores objects and functions. The stack is for storing static data, such as primitive data types values.

The call stack is a mechanism JavaScript uses to keep track of functions that needs to be executed. Web APIs are APIs built into your web browser. These APIs allow you to use features you could not otherwise. Some example are fetch API, geolocation API, WebGL API, Web Workers API and so on.

These APIs are not part of the JavaScript language itself. They are interfaces built on top of the core JavaScript language. This is also why they are available in all JavaScript environments. Another thing web APIs also handle are [async functions] and also `setTimeout` methods. Now, about the message queue and event loop.
