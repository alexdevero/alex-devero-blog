## A quick introduction

Chances are that you've already heard about this thing called "Garbage collection". If not, here is short version. JavaScript is a very unique language. Unlike other languages, JavaScript is able to automatically allocate memory when it is needed. it can also release that memory when it is not needed anymore.

When you create new object, you don't have to use special method to allocate memory for that object. When you no longer need that object, you don't have to use another special method to release that memory. JavaScript will do this for you. It will automatically check if there is a need for memory allocation or memory release.

If there is such a need, JavaScript will do the work necessary to fulfill that need. It will do all this without you even knowing about it. This a good and also a bad thing. It is good because you don't have to worry about this too much. It is a bad thing because it can make you think you don't have to worry about this at all.

The problem is that JavaScript can help you with this memory management only to some degree. It also can't help you if you start throwing obstacles in the way. Before we get to garbage collection, let's quickly talk about memory and memory management.
