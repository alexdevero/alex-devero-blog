# JavaScript Classes and Static Methods and Properties

JavaScript classes are one of the most discussed features of ES6. Two interesting features of classes are static methods and properties. In this tutorial, you will learn what static methods and properties are and how they work. You will also learn how to use these methods and properties in your projects.

## Introduction

Let's start with the basics. Every static method and property has to start with the `static` keyword. This tells JavaScript that the method or property that follows after this keyword should be defined as static. Now, the more interesting question. How are static methods and properties different from normal methods and properties?

The main difference between static and normal methods and properties is two-fold. First, you can call static methods, and access static properties, without having to [instantiate class] in which they are defined. Second, you can't call these methods, and access these properties, on instances of the class in which they are defined.

JavaScript developers usually use static methods and properties something like utility functions and utility properties. For example, you can use static method to create a method that will help you compare two instances of the class. One thing you can do with static properties is keeping count of how many instances some class has.
