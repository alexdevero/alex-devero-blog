## Introduction to how to access object properties

Objects are one of the data types in JavaScript. They allow you to store data in key-value pairs. Those "keys" in those pairs are also called properties.

In JavaScript there are multiple ways you can use to access one of those properties. These are dot notation, bracket notation and destructuring. Dot notation is sometimes also called dot property accessor. Another name for bracket notation is square brackets property access. There is one important thing to mention.

All these ways assume you know the name of the property you want to access. If you don't know it, nothing is lost. You can [loops] to iterate over object to get all properties, including the one you want. You will get to this as well.
