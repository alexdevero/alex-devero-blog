## React useRef hook briefly

The useRef hook may not be as popular as other hooks such as [useState], [useEffect] and [useReducer]. Due to this, it may not be clear what is the purpose of this hook. Nonetheless, useRef hook can be very useful in certain situations. The ref, in useRef, is a shorthand for "reference".

What this hook does is it allows you to store data, and persist them across renders. What's even more interesting and important, this hook does this without causing the component to re-render. This means that when you update the value stored by useRef, React will not re-render your component.

The most common use case for the useRef hook is to store references to DOM nodes and React elements. This then allows you to access these nodes directly and work with them as you need. This is similar to using JavaScript `querySelector()` method to find DOM node and storing the node in a variable.
