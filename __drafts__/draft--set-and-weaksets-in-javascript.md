## Introduction to Sets

Sets are a new object type that was introduced to JavaScript with ES6 (ES2015). What sets allow you to do is to create collections of values. These values can be anything, from [numbers] and [strings] to [arrays] and [objects]. This doesn't sound like something exciting. You can do the same thing with arrays.

The thing about sets, and where they differ from arrays, is that they can contain only unique values. When you try to add multiple same values into a set it will accept only the first. Any subsequent same value will be ignored. This also applies to values such as [null] and undefined. Each will be added only once.

This is one of the reasons why JavaScript developers sometimes choose sets over arrays. When you want to create a collection of some values, and you need all values to be unique, sets are the easiest option.
