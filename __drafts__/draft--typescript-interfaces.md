# TypeScript Interfaces: A Quick Guide to Help You Start

TypeScript brings many useful improvements to JavaScript language. One of them is static typing system that can help you write type safe code. Interfaces are part of this typing system. This tutorial will help you learn what TypeScript interfaces are, how they work and how to use them.<!--more-->

## JavaScript, objects and black swans

In JavaScript, and elsewhere as well, objects are one of the most popular ways to group related data together and pass them around. The problem is, there is no way in JavaScript to specify how certain object should look like. There is no way to say what properties should object have or what their values should be.

This makes it easy to create code that is prone to errors. For example, to create an object and forget to add some property. Then, when it comes the time to finally use that object, you code will fail and program will crash. Reason? Your program expected specific property that is that is missing.

The problem might not be a missing property. It might be that the type of a value of some property is different from what your program expected. The result is often the same. Code fails and program crashes. One may argue that this is not likely to happen. Well, earthquakes and floods are also not likely to happen.

The thing is, nobody cares about probability when these events, these [black swans], occur. Your users will not care that wrong type or missing property is not likely to happen when the app they are using crashes. If only there was a way to avoid this. Maybe, TypeScript can help here.
