## Object literal

Using object literals is the first way to create objects in JavaScript. It is probably also the easiest to learn, remember and use. This is probably also why it is the most popular way to create objects in JavaScript. Creating an object this way is simple. You wrap the key-value pairs with curly brackets (`{}`).

Those key-value pairs are pairs of `keys` and `values` you want the object to have. Another name for object `key` that is used very often is "property". Keys, or properties, are on the left side of the pair and values on the right. Between these two are colons (`key: value`).

When you wrap this pair with curly brackets you have an object. If you want to create an empty object you use only the curly brackets. After that, you can assign that new object to some variable. Or, you can use it right away as you want.

```JavaScript
// Creating object with object literal
const myObj = {
  // One key-value pair
  someKey: 'Some value'
}

// Creating an empty object with object literal
const myObj = {}
```
