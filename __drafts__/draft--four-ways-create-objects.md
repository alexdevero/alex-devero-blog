## Object literal

## No.1: Object literal

Using object literals is the first way to create objects in JavaScript. It is probably also the easiest to learn, remember and use. This is probably also why it is the most popular way to create objects in JavaScript. Creating an object this way is simple. You wrap the key-value pairs with curly brackets (`{}`).

Those key-value pairs are pairs of `keys` and `values` you want the object to have. Another name for object `key` that is used very often is "property". Keys, or properties, are on the left side of the pair and values on the right. Between these two are colons (`key: value`).

When you wrap this pair with curly brackets you have an object. If you want to create an empty object you use only the curly brackets. After that, you can assign that new object to some [variable]. Or, you can use it right away as you want.

```JavaScript
// Creating object with object literal.
const myObj = {
  name: 'Tom Jones',// One key-value pair.
  role: 'admin',
  isWorking: false
}

// Log the object to console.
console.log(myObj)
// Output:
// {
//   name: 'Tom Jones',
//   role: 'admin',
//   isWorking: false
// }


// Creating an empty object with object literal.
const myEmptyObj = {}

// Log the object to console.
console.log(myEmptyObj)
// Output:
// {}
```
```
