JavaScript can "convert" their vales to boolean, either `true` or `false`. Which boolean will it be depends on the data type you are working with.

Boolean has only two possible values, `true` and `false`. This also creates a limit for how JavaScript can "convert" values. When JavaScript "converts" values to be either or false it uses specific set of rules. These rules are implemented at the core of the language and are very unlikely to change.
