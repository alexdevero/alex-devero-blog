## A quick introduction

There are multiple ways methods to store data in the browser. You can store data using [IndexedDB], [Cache] and cookies. Aside to these, there is also the Web Storage API. This API provides two additional mechanisms you can use to store data in the browser. These mechanisms are local storage and session storage.

One benefit of this additional Web Storage API is that it makes it easier to store data in the browser. Yes, you can store some simple data with cookies. However, even that can be tedious. The same applies to IndexedDB. The Cache? The problem here is that most of it is experimental and doesn't work in all browsers, and without HTTPS.

This can't be said about Web Storage API. With The Web Storage API, saving, retrieving, deleting and also checking for existence of data is simple and easy.
