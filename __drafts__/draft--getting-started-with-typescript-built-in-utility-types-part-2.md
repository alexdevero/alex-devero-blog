# Getting Started With Built-in Utility Types in TypeScript Part 1

TypeScript comes with a number of built-in utility types. These types can be very useful. They can help you create new, and also very advanced, types from existing with only a bit of code. In this article, you will learn about some of these utility types, how they work and also how to use them.<!--more-->

## A quick introduction

The goal of this two-part article is to help you understand TypeScript built-in utility types. In this second part, you will learn about the last eight of these types. These are `NonNullable`, `Parameters`, `ConstructorParameters`, `ReturnType`, `InstanceType`, `ThisParameterType`, `OmitThisParameter` and `ThisType`.

If you want to learn about the previous eight, take a look at the [part 1]. Part 1 will help you understand and work with `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Record`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Exclude` and `Extract`. Otherwise, keep reading.

## Note on availability
