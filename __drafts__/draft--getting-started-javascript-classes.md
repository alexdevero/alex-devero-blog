## A quick introduction

Before we dive into how to get started with JavaScript classes, let's quickly talk about few things. First, classes were added to JavaScript in ES6 specification (ECMAScript 2015). Second, they are not a new feature per se. Classes basically provide a different way to [create objects] and work with [prototypes] and inheritance.

This is also why many JavaScript developers call classes a syntactic sugar. They are correct. Classes are a syntactic sugar. Under the hood, you are still working with objects, prototypes and so on. The only real difference is in the syntax you are using. Another is that your code will not work in IE. [Babel] will help you fix this.

That being said, there is nothing wrong with using JavaScript classes over other older options. It is mainly a matter of your preference. If you like them, use them. If you don't, don't. Now, let's take a look at what you need to know to get started with JavaScript classes.

## The syntax

The syntax of classes is easy to learn and remember. Every class starts with `class` keyword. Next comes body of the class, a block of code wrapped with curly brackets. There are no parentheses and parameters you know from [functions]. When you declare new class, the convention is to start with a capital letter.

```JavaScript
// Create new class called "MyClass":
class MyClass {
  // Body of the class.
}
```
