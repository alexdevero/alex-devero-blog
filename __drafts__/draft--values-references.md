## A short introduction

In JavaScript, there are the two categories of data types you can work with. First category are primitive data types. At this moment, there exist [seven primitive types]. These primitive data types are number, string, boolean, `null`, `undefined`, BigInt and Symbol. The BigInt and Symbol are newer data types.

Symbol was introduced in [ES6] specification. The BigInt was introduced later, in [ES2020] specification. When something is not one of these primitive data types it is technically an object. This applies to actual objects as well as arrays and even functions. From the view of JavaScript, these are all objects.

This distinction between primitive data types and objects is important because JavaScript handles each differently.
