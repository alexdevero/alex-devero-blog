JavaScript is a very forgiving programming language. It allows you to do a lot, in many ways. It also does a lot of work for you. Memory management is one of these things. Ask yourself: how many time did you have to think about allocating memory for your variables or functions?

How many times did you have to think about releasing that memory when you no longer needed those variables or functions? Chances are not even once.
