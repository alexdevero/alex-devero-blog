## A quick overview of React hooks

It was in [React v16.8] when React hooks were introduced by React team. Since then, hooks quickly rose in popularity among React developers, and even beyond. Until then, when you wanted to use state and lifecycle methods inside React components you had to use [JavaScript classes].

React hooks changed this paradigm. With hooks, you no longer have to create components with classes just so you can use state. You can just as well create functional components. Then, you can use hooks to "enhance" these components with whatever feature you need, be it a state, lifecycle method or something else.

The word "hook" may sound a bit vague. To make it easier, think about hooks simply as functions. This is what hooks are, plain [JavaScript functions]. These functions allow you "hook into" various React features, such as state and lifecycle. Most popular examples are [useState] and [useEffect] hooks.

The useState hooks allows you to bring state to function components. With useEffect hook, you can work with component lifecycle. There is a couple of React [hooks] ready to use. However, these hooks can't do everything. They can't cover every possible scenario. Fortunately, these hooks are not the only option.
